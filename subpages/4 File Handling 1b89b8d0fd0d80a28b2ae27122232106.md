# 4. File Handling

As a data analyst, you’ll frequently read from and write to files such as **text files, CSV files, and JSON files.** Python provides built-in modules (`open()`, `csv`, and `json`) and powerful libraries like **Pandas** for handling these files efficiently.

# Reading and Writing Text Files

Python’s `open()`  function allows you to read and write files easily.

## **Opening a File (`open()`)**

```python
file = open("example.txt", "w") # Open a file in write mode
file.write("Hello, World!\nThis is a sample file.") # Write test
file.close() # Close the file
```

## **Using a Context Manager** (with `open()`)

The `with` statement **automatically closes** the file after use.

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
	content = file.read() # Read entire content
	print(content)
```

```
Hello, World!
This is a sample file.
```

## **Reading Line by Line**

```python
with open("example.txt", "r") as file:
	for line in file:
		print(line.strip()) # Removes newline characters
```

```
Hello, World!
This is a sample file.
```

## **Appending to a File**

```python
with open("example.txt", "a") as file:
	file.write("\nAppending new data!")
```

# Working with CSV Files

CSV (Comma-Separated Values) files are widely used in data analytics.

## **Writing to a CSV File (`csv` module)**

```python
import csv

data = [
				["Name", "Age", "City"],
				["Alice", 25, "New York"],
				["Bob", 30, "San Francisco"]
			 ]

with open("data.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
	writer = csv.writer(file)
	writer.writerows(data)
```

## **Reading a CSV File**

```python
with open("data.csv", "r") as file:
	reader = csv.reader(file)
	for row in reader:
		print(row)
```

```
['Name', 'Age', 'City']
['Alice', '25', 'New York']
['Bob', '30', 'San Francisco']
```

## **Using Pandas for CSV Files**

Pandas makes it easier to work with CSV files.

```python
import pandas as pd

df = pd.read_csv("data.csv")
print(df)
```

```
   	Name   Age            City
0  Alice    25        New York
1    Bob    30   San Francisco
```

## **Writing to a CSV with Pandas**

```python
df.to_csv("output.csv", index=False) # Write without adding an extra index column
```

# Working with JSON Files

JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is widely used for storing structured data.

## **Writing JSON Data**

```python
import json

data = {"name": "Alice",
				"age" : 25,
				"city": "New York"}
				
with open("data.json", "w") as file:
	json.dump(data, file, indent=4) # Write JSON with indentation
```

## **Reading JSON data**

```python
with open("data.json", "r") as file:
	data = json.load(file)
	print(data)
```

```
{'name': 'Alice', 'age': 25, 'city': 'New York'}
```

# Practice Problems

## **Text File Handling:**

1. Create a text file names `"notes.txt"`.
2. Write three lines of text to it.
3. Read and print the content.

```python
with open("notes.txt", "w") as file:
	file.write("Line 1: Learning Python\n")
	file.write("Line 2: Data Analytics is exciting!\n")
	file.write("Line 3: File Handling is important.\n")
	
with open("notes.txt", "r") as file:
	text_content = file.read()
```

```
Line 1: Learning Python
Line 2: Data Analytics is exciting!
Line 3: File handling is important.
```

## **CSV File Handling:**

1. Create a CSV file `"students.csv"` with columns `["ID", "Name", "Score"]`.
2. Add three rows of data.
3. Read and print the file contents.

```python
import csv

students_data = [["ID", "Name", "Score"],
								 [1, "Alice", 48],
								 [2, "Bob", 60],
								 [3, "Charlie", 78]]
								 
with open("students.csv", "w", newline="") as file:
	writer = csv.writer(file)
	writer.writerows(students_data)
	
with open("students.csv", "r") as file:
	reader = csv.reader(file)
	for row in reader:
		print(row)
```

```
['ID', 'Name', 'Score']
['1', 'Alice', '85']
['2', 'Bob', '90']
['3', 'Charlie', '78']
```

## **JSON File Handling:**

1. Create a JSON file `"person.json"` storing `name`, `age`, and `city`.
2. Read the JSON file and print the values.

```python
import json

person_data = {"name": "John Doe",
							 "age": 29,
							 "city": "Los Angeles"}
							 
with open("person.json", "w") as file:
	json.dumps(person_data, file, indent=4)
	
with open("person.json", "r") as file:
	data = json.load(file)
	print(data)
```

```
{'name': 'John Doe', 'age': 29, 'city': 'Los Angeles'}
```
